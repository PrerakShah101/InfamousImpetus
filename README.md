# INFAMOUS IMPETUS – A Superhero Dispatcher RPG

**INFAMOUS IMPETUS** is a text-based, stat-driven mini RPG where you play as a *Dispatcher* — the behind-the-scenes strategist for a chaotic superhero team. Your job isn’t to fight but to send the right hero based on each crisis’s hidden mix of **Brain, Brawn, and Charm (BBC)**. Choose wisely: after three consecutive mission failures, you're pulled from duty.

The game features 10 vivid, uniquely written crisis scenarios and 3 operatives with distinct personalities and strengths. Each hero has a profile (e.g., Captain Captivating leans on charm, Canny Granny excels in brains, and Dawn of Brawn leads with raw power). Your decisions are scored by comparing hero stats to problem demands — close matches lead to success, while poor ones end in mission failure.

This project is inspired by the indie game **Dispatch** by That’s Not Canon Productions, which flips the superhero genre by focusing on the mind behind the mission, not the muscle in the field. INFAMOUS IMPETUS takes that concept into a simpler Python terminal experience with dramatic flair and character-driven fun.
